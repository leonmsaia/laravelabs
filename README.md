Laravel Docker Implementation for Learning Purposes

Step 1: Clone the Repository Clone the repository from GitHub: 
`git clone https://github.com/leonmsaia/laravelabs.git`

Step 2: Configure the .env File Complete the .env file with the desired data as needed. (It can be left as default)

Step 3: Build and Run Docker Containers docker-compose up --build This will build the necessary Docker containers, namely: Laravel (11.0.0), MySQL, phpMyAdmin, MongoDB.

Step 5: Access Laravel and phpMyAdmin Once the previous steps are completed, Laravel should be available at http://localhost:8000 and phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8081. You can access phpMyAdmin using the credentials defined in the .env file.

That's it! Now you have a lab environment to study, modify, create, break, and recreate a complete Laravel Enhancement System With Multiple Databases.
